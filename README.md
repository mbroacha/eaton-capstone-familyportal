Framer prototype for a data visualization for disaster responders. This was created for a capstone project between Eaton and Carnegie Mellon University.

Note that the Material Design components used in this prototype were borrowed from [Jess Gadd](https://blog.framer.com/introducing-the-materialcomponents-module-for-framer-890d32f09b6d) with some corrections.
